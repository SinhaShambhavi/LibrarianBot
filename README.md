##### *Conversational Chatbot as an Online Librarian* : In this Natural Language Processing project, we have attempted to build a Telegram based chatbot for libraries. The convenience of our system is its ability to seamlessly integrate itself with the popular messaging application, Telegram. The chatbot is able to take in the text through Telegram and perform its various functions. The primary features of the bot include retrieving all the information about names of books, bookID and the links to the books , thanks to the Google Books API.
